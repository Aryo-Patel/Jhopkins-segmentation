- Get training loss to zero on one batch?

Take-aways
- funny that when you have a ReLU --> sigmoid --> threshold to map values < 0.5 to 1 AND you're working over sparse data, you force the model to learn how to activate weights to give a "zero" (or in this case, 0.5) output
    - - How can I get outputs that have the perfect images from the training samples in commit a2053a3? (fixed above)
